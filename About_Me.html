<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm Currently in my penultimate year of the bachelor of IT offered by QUT and plan to persue a masters degree in data analytics. I enjoy solving complex problems and creating data-driven solutions.
   I have a strong foundation in SQL, Python, R, Javascript and C#, driven by a passion for turning data into actionable insights. My journey in data science is fueled by deep curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning.
   I actively leverage resources such as Kaggle, Tableau Public, Leetcode and Coursera to stay ahead of the curve, sharpen my skills, and explore the latest trends and tools in the data industry.
  With extensive knowledge of multiple programming languages, I am well-equipped to tackle diverse data challenges, from data preprocessing to uncovering valuable insights through data visualization.
  Iâ€™m excited to collaborate with others in the field, contribute to innovative projects, and grow my expertise in this ever-evolving landscape.
