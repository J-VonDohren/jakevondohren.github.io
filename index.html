            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Currently in my penultimate year of the bachelor of IT offered by QUT and plan to persue a masters degree in data analytics. I enjoy solving complex problems and creating data-driven solutions.
              a strong foundation in SQL, Python, R, and C#, driven by a passion for turning data into actionable insights. My journey in data science is fueled by deep curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning.
              I actively leverage resources such as Kaggle, Tableau Public, Leetcode and Coursera to stay ahead of the curve, sharpen my skills, and explore the latest trends and tools in the data industry.
              With extensive knowledge of multiple programming languages, I am well-equipped to tackle diverse data challenges, from data preprocessing to uncovering valuable insights through data visualization.
              I’m excited to collaborate with others in the field, contribute to innovative projects, and grow my expertise in this ever-evolving landscape.

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/J-VonDohren/C-_Hospital_System ">Project 1: Hospital System</a> - Designed and developed a hospital management system using object-oriented programming principles to streamline operations, refactoring code to improve performance and maintainability. Implemented robust error-handling strategies to enhance debugging and scalability while executing various software testing techniques to ensure the system's reliability and robustness.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/J-VonDohren/SQL ">Project 2: SQL database management</a> - Designed and implemented a MySQL database schema using SQL scripts, incorporating multiple tables with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure seamless execution in a single run. Developed and executed efficient Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands for data insertion, updates, and deletions, and crafted complex SQL queries involving multi-table joins to extract meaningful insights. Additionally, applied Data Control Language (DCL) commands to manage user permissions and maintain database security.</li>
